Dear Andre, <br>
You are my favorite guy in the whole world. I love all of our adventures together, especially when we just sit and chitchat. I am so excited to spend your 23rd birthday with you and spoil you with Dune, Slouchy Jr., the funny shirt and a special meal together. I want you to feel loved no matter what and especially celebrate you for existing and making my life so much better. You are so special to me, and I love our snuggles and cuddles. Thank you for making me feel so loved. I appreciate everything you do for me and for us. I cannot wait to live with Cashew and our animal family which is so big already. <br><br>
Sometimes I wish things were easier, because we'd be able to focus on all of the good things that are coming, instead of smaller negative things. But the push and pull can be like the waves of the ocean (or Lake Michigan), and then it seems necessary. I think we're just taking a second to figure out our rhythm. It's hard with so many changes happening constantly. I know it's especially hard for you because you're way less patient than me. If there was ever a person to figure these things out with though, I think it's you. The way our lives have come together and the way that our personalities compare and contrast is like Ratatouille but irl. <br> <br>
Thank you for being as silly as me, and kinda funny sometimes.
