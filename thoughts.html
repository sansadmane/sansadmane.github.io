<p>
    having a passport is a privilege. but for me it's the only way i can see any family except my parents and siblings. 17 hours of travel, for many, is an exotic trip or vacation, but for me it's the minimum to see my grandparents. i live with the knowledge and fear that if anything were to happen to any of my extended family, the soonest i could get there would be in 17 hours. for those that live in less accessible towns, this could go up by 24 hours.
    <br> <br>
    before covid, i took for granted the trips my family had taken to india to see our relatives, when i was younger. i had lived in india for four years during middle school and i got a taste of always living within a 10 hour train ride of my grandparents. i have not seen my grandparents since i was 15 years old, and it takes a toll. during the hardest weeks of college, i would work/study for maybe 15 hours a day. could that be a trip to india? 
    <br><br>
    with every hour of homework and classes that i have taken, i have compared it to the amount of travel needed to see most of my family. i have taken several 17-18 hour semesters - that's just a one-way flight or set of flights to india. weekends spent studying - that's maybe a round trip. but it takes a toll, because i was raised to feel obligated to take care of my family, and feel bad if i didn't. it was only after starting therapy during junior year that i started to heal from the expectations my parents had raised me with. "your parents don't have to say what you want them to," was a hard pill to swallow when all i wanted to hear was a "good job", an "i'm proud of you," not a "why not 105%" on a test that had no extra credit but i scored a 100% on. a lot of people think that my parents jest, but these same thoughts are reflected by my grandparents on our weekly FaceTime calls <em>they don't even know how tall i am compared to them anymore. </em>

<center><h2> Songs that Go Well Together </h1></center>
    <p>
	As someone who has been playing piano since I was five, and performed chorally throughout middle and high school, I have musical opinions. One of my favorite things to do is pairing songs together for that smooth transition.
	I hope to update this list with some pairings I've picked!
