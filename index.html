<h1> Hi! I'm Sanskruti Admane.</h1>

<div class = "column">
<p>
I'm a <b><a href = "aboutme.html">PhD student</a></b> at Rice University, in the EEPS (Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences) Department. I graduated magna cum laude from Ohio State University with a B.S. in <b><a>Physics and Astronomy</a></b>, and a minor in <b><a>computer science</a></b>. 
<br><br>
During my time in undergrad, I researched <b><a>terrestrial planet formation</a></b> with Dr. Seth Jacobson at Michigan State University. I was working on quantifying debris production in imperfect accretion scenarios. For a formal discussion of this research, I have a paper in prep. I am currently working with Dr. Andre Izidoro to further investigate different aspects of Solar System formation.
