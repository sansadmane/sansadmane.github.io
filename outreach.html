	During undergraduate, I was the chair of the <b><a href = "https://astronomy.osu.edu/undergraduates/umaac">Undergraduate Majors/Minors of Astronomy and Astrophysics Committee (UMAAC)</a></b>. UMAAC held regular social events to foster an inclusive environment. As chair, I led the committee through a fund application supported by the DEIJ office, receiving funds to host events that promoted intercultural impact. <br>
<br><br>
I was also an undergraduate representative on the <b><a href = "https://physics.osu.edu/faculty-staff/climate-and-diversity-committee" >Physics Climate and Diversity Committee</a></b>. I connected undergraduates to grad students, post-docs and faculty. I contributed to the Diversity Statement for the Physics department.
<br><br>
I enjoy volunteering when I can, and have assisted several organizations over the years, including Habitat for Humanity, CoSI (children's science museum in Columbus), and Planned Parenthood.

Since Summer 2021, I have been privately tutoring students in high school in STEM classes. My primary focus is to develop the confidence of the young women I mentor as they start to pursue college-level classes and education. 
<br><br>
I have also been participating in <b><a href = 'https://prescientist.org/about-us/'>Letters to a Pre-Scientist</a></b> (LPS) since Fall 2023. This program connects middle school students with post-graduate scientists to broaden their perspectives of who scientists are. Improving diversity and retention in science starts at the elementary schooling level, so this work is important to me to share accessible pathways for students who may not have or know about available opportunities.
<br><br>
Since arriving at Rice, I have also been the Treasurer for GeoUnion, our department's grad student association. With this role, I have helped plan events and send weekly information.

	<h2><center>Future</center></h2>
<p>
I am launching the Houston satellite of <a href = "https://astronomyontap.org/">Astronomy on Tap</a>! This opens up astronomy to space enthusiasts and professionals alike and will create an informal setting for Houston to talk space. Please <a href="contact.html"> contact me </a> if you are interested in learning more, or helping organize meetings.
