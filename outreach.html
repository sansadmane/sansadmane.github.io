I'm the chair of the <b><a href = "https://astronomy.osu.edu/undergraduates/umaac">Undergraduate Majors/Minors of Astronomy and Astrophysics Committee (UMAAC)</a></b>. I have been a part of this committee since my first year at OSU. UMAAC holds regular social events and mixers to foster an inclusive environment. Our goal is to create a safe space for minorities in the department, by strengthening intercultural relationships. <br>
UMAAC recently applied for and was awarded a fund to hold DEIJ promoting events for Autumn 2023. We plan to have four events throughout the semester. Feel free to reach out to me about getting involved!
<br><br>
I am also an undergraduate representative on the <b><a href = "https://physics.osu.edu/faculty-staff/climate-and-diversity-committee" >Physics Climate and Diversity Committee</a></b>. I connect undergraduates to grad students, post-docs and faculty, making sure everyone's voice is represented through me. We are currently developing a Diversity Statement for the Physics department.
<br><br>
Since Summer 2021, I have been privately tutoring and mentoring students in high school in STEM classes. My primary focus is to develop a mentoring relationship with young women interested in STEM, so I can encourage them to pursue the careers they want to. I have worked with students in the US as well as India.
