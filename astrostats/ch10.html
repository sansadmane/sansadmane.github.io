<h1>Truncated and Censored Data</h1>
<p>
Truncation refers to objects in a dataset that are entirely missing (including undetected objects). Censored data contains lower/upper limits. Upper limits refer to left-censored data points. From handling these types of this data, we want: correlations when upper limits are present, distribution functions, regression, and to discuss what to do IF ANYTHING with these truncated data sets.
</p>

<ul>

<li>Survival analysis is used to study the time until an event occurs, such as machine failure, death, relapse, or arrival of an event of interest.</li>

<li>The survival time is typically modeled as a nonnegative random variable \(T\) with:
    <ul>
        <li>the survival function \(S(t) = P(T > t)\),</li>
        <li>the cumulative distribution function \(F(t) = P(T \le t)\),</li>
        <li>the probability density function \(f(t) = F'(t)\),</li>
        <li>the hazard function  
        \[
        h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{S(t)}.
        \]</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>Censoring refers to incomplete observation of the event time.
    <ul>
        <li>Right censoring: the event has not occurred by the end of study; we only know \(T > C\).</li>
        <li>Left censoring: event occurs before observation starts; we only know \(T < C\).</li>
        <li>Interval censoring: event occurs in an unknown interval \([L, R]\).</li>
        <li>Right censoring is the most common and is directly supported by Kaplan–Meier estimation.</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>Truncation occurs when the only individuals included in the dataset are those whose event times fall within an observable window.
    <ul>
        <li>Left truncation: subjects enter the study only if \(T > L\) (must survive past an entry time).</li>
        <li>Right truncation: subjects appear only if \(T < R\) (less common, arises in retrospective studies).</li>
        <li>Truncation affects the risk set and requires adjusted likelihoods for valid estimation.</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>The Kaplan–Meier estimator (KM estimator) is a nonparametric estimator of the survival function that correctly handles right-censored data.
    <ul>
        <li>The KM estimate is defined as  
        \[
        \hat{S}(t) = \prod_{t_i \le t} \left(1 - \frac{d_i}{n_i}\right)
        \]
        where  
        \(t_i\) = distinct event times,  
        \(d_i\) = number of events at time \(t_i\),  
        \(n_i\) = number at risk just prior to \(t_i\).</li>

        <li>The estimate is a step function that drops at observed event times and remains flat during censored intervals.</li>

        
    </ul>
</li>

<li>Kaplan–Meier with left-truncated data adjusts the risk sets.
    <ul>
        <li>At each event time \(t_i\), only individuals who have already entered the study (i.e., whose entry time \(L_j \le t_i\)) are counted in the risk set.</li>
        <li>The KM estimator formula remains the same, but \(n_i\) is computed using the truncated risk set.</li>
        <li>This allows valid estimation when subjects become observable only after surviving a certain time.</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>Survival curves can be compared between groups using the log-rank test, which tests the null hypothesis that survival functions are equal across groups.</li>
<li>The Cox Proportional Hazards Model is a semiparametric model used to relate survival time to covariates without assuming a specific baseline distribution for survival times.
    <ul>
        <li>The hazard function for an individual with covariate vector \(x\) is modeled as
        \[
        h(t \mid x) = h_0(t) \exp(\beta^\top x)
        \]
        where  
        \(h_0(t)\) = baseline hazard (unspecified),  
        \(\beta\) = regression coefficients describing covariate effects.</li>

        <li>The model is called “proportional hazards” because the ratio of hazards for any two individuals is constant over time:
        \[
        \frac{h(t \mid x_1)}{h(t \mid x_2)} 
        = \exp\!\big(\beta^\top (x_1 - x_2)\big).
        \]
        Thus, covariates multiply the hazard over time, painting the same shape.</li>

        <li>The Cox model is fitted using partial likelihood rather than full likelihood.</li>

        <li>No assumptions are made about \(h_0(t)\), so the model is flexible but still provides interpretable effect sizes.</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>Hazard ratios describe how covariates affect the hazard (event rate) over time.
    <ul>
        <li>The hazard ratio (HR) comparing two individuals with covariate values \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) is
        \[
        HR = \exp\!\big(\beta^\top (x_1 - x_2)\big).
        \]</li>

        <li>For a single covariate \(x\) with coefficient \(\beta\), increasing \(x\) by one unit multiplies the hazard by
        \[
        HR = \exp(\beta).
        \]</li>

        <li>This is how to interpret the values.
            <ul>
                <li>\(\exp(\beta) > 1\): higher hazard (event occurs sooner).</li>
                <li>\(\exp(\beta) < 1\): lower hazard (event occurs later).</li>
                <li>\(\exp(\beta) = 1\): no effect on hazard.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Hazard ratios are relative measures: they compare rates of occurrence but do not directly translate to differences in survival times.</li>

    </ul>
</li>


</ul>
